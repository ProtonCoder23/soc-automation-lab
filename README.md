# SOC Automation with Wazuh, TheHive, and Shuffle (DigitalOcean Deployment)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to automate Security Operations Center (SOC) workflows by integrating:
- **Wazuh** for log collection, SIEM functionality, and threat detection
- **TheHive** for security incident management and response
- **Shuffle** as the SOAR engine to orchestrate alert handling and automate playbooks

All components are deployed on **DigitalOcean** cloud infrastructure using separate droplets to simulate a cloud-based SOC setup.
